# TowerOfHanoiVisual

This project adds a visualization to the classic "Tower of Hanoi" problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) using the p5.js framework.
After selecting the number of discs to run the simulation with (using a dropdown menu), hitting the spacebar will start the animation. I have plans to 
animate the discs actually moving between pillars (rather than just changing the x/y values) but the foundational work exists here.

Here's a sample video animation showing the simulation with 6 discs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdlIxNMqy8M&ab_channel=DezyPad
